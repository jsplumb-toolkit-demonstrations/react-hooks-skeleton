## React Skeleton (Hooks)

This demonstration shows how to perform the basic tasks needed to get a Toolkit application up and running with React. The app was created with `create-react-app`.  The code is documented throughout so this page just gives a brief overview. 

This demonstration uses Hooks and requires version 5.x of the Toolkit, which is currently in beta. More detailed documentation to follow.
